"""
Inside conditions.json, you will see a subset of UNSW courses mapped to their 
corresponding text conditions. We have slightly modified the text conditions
to make them simpler compared to their original versions.

Your task is to complete the is_unlocked function which helps students determine 
if their course can be taken or not. 

We will run our hidden tests on your submission and look at your success rate.
We will only test for courses inside conditions.json. We will also look over the 
code by eye.

NOTE: This challenge is EXTREMELY hard and we are not expecting anyone to pass all
our tests. In fact, we are not expecting many people to even attempt this.
For complete transparency, this is worth more than the easy challenge. 
A good solution is favourable but does not guarantee a spot in Projects because
we will also consider many other criteria.
